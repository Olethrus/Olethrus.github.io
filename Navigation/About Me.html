  <h2> Technology Experience </h2>
  <p>My experience as a system integrator has been very broad across a wide range of PLC and HMI systems. I chase after the projects that are outside the normal cookie cutter projects. I have also wrote computer code as a hobby going all the way back to middle school. I am a very eager to learn new things and enjoy the challenge of figuring new things out</p>
