      <p>My experience as a system integrator has been very broad across a wide range of PLC and HMI systems. I am also one of the few people at Interstates that takes on the odd or unique projects. I have also wrote computer code as a hobby going all the way back to middle school. I am a very eager to learn new things and enjoy the challenge of figuring new things out.</p>
