    <td>Recieveing & Loadout Facility</td>
    <td>This facility would recieve, store, dry and then load out product.</td>
    <td>We used a CMC web server integrated into a Allen bradley PLC that made use of a Redlion as a gateway to translate the modbus TCP protocol to the AB PLC. At another similar facility we removed the red lion and talked directly to the PLC using a rockwell modbus TCP block. At another plant we used kepware to interface M340 with a Rockwell SE application.</td>
			<td>Depending on the product a lot of times sites willl tend to want to stop the conveyors loaded and not clean out. This minimizes downtime to get product moving again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>HVAC System for a Chemical Plant</td>
    <td>This facility would produce chemicals. We were in charge of keeping everything cool, exhausting or containing chemicals in the event of a leak or keeping things from freezing.</td>
    <td>We used the modbus TCP block here to talk to an OEM controller to tell AC Units to start stop and read some status values.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Pet Food processing Facility</td>
    <td>This facility would process and color pet food and then run it through an extruder.</td>
    <td>We made use of PlantPAX controls along with a simple from scratch batching routine that we developed.</td>
			<td>The heat created can be to much for a workstation to handle had to add an additional cooler to the panel in order for the application to run smoothly.</td>

    <td>Deployed</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Packaging Facility</a></td>
    <td>We had to quickly move and dose a system that would then package a container that needed high accuracy.</td>
    <td>We used multiple servoes here to calculate the weight needed and based off a static value does the system with in a reasonable tollerance.</td>

    <td>Deployed</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Rendering Facility</a></td>
    <td>We had to take scrap product and then press through to the rest of the process. But we also had to avoid over filling the rendering tanks.</td>
    <td>Keep workstations out of hazardous areas.</td>
			<td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>

	<tr>
    <td>Fabrication Facility</td>
    <td>We had to move product to assemble within a specific tolerance.</td>
    <td>Synchronized movements are key when moving things together. Always keep failsafes for pauses when out of tollerance.</td>
